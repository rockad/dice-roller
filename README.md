## Multiplayer Dice Roller Game Description

### **Project:** Real-time Multiplayer Dice Roller

**Concept:** A fun and interactive web-based game where multiple users can join a session, roll the dice, and compete to
achieve the highest score.

### **Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (leveraging React)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* _(Optional) **Styling:**_ Custom CSS, CSS Modules or UI framework

**Core Features:**

1. **Real-time Multiplayer:** Allows multiple users to connect to the same game session. Player
   actions (like rolling the dice) and score updates are reflected for all participants in the session.
2. **User Management:** Basic user identification within a session (e.g., assigning a temporary username or unique ID
   upon joining).
3. **Dice Rolling:** An intuitive interface allows each player to trigger their dice roll. The outcome of the roll
   should be visually displayed.
4. **Score Tracking:** The game maintains an individual score for each connected player. Scores are updated
   automatically.
5. **Game State Management:** The application manages the overall game state: players turns, game phase (game on, game
   finished).
6. **Winner Declaration:** Upon completion of the game (e.g., after five rounds or when a player reaches a target
   score), the system automatically identifies and clearly displays the winner based on the final scores.
7. **Leaderboard:** A dedicated section or view displays the scores achieved across game sessions.
8. **Reset Functionality:** Players have the option to reset their scores or start a new game session, allowing for
   continuous play.

### **Technical Implementation Notes:**

* **Next.js:** Provides the application structure, routing, and potentially API routes for handling game logic or user
  management if not purely client-side/WebSocket based. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) can
  be used for initial page loads, while client-side React handles the dynamic UI updates.
* **React:** Used to build reusable UI components (Dice display, Scoreboard, Player list, Buttons, Leaderboard). State
  management within React (e.g., `useState`, `useReducer`, or context API) will handle individual component states.
* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety throughout the codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving developer
  experience, especially important for managing complex game states and WebSocket message structures.
* _(Optional) **CSS:**_ Custom CSS, CSS Modules or UI
  framework ([Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui), etc.) could be used for
  styling the game interface, but not mandatory.
* _(Optional) **WebSockets:**_ For the real-time communication layer, enabling instant updates between players without
  constant polling.
